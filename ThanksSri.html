        <h2 class="Chai">American Authors | 2014</h2>
        <pre class = "Joy">
            I had a dream so big and loud
            I jumped so high I touched the clouds
            Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh
            I stretched my hands out to the sky
            We danced with monsters through the night
            Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh
            
            I'm never gonna look back, whoa
            I'm never gonna give it up, no
            Please don't wake me now (two, three, four)
            
            This is gonna be the best day of my life
            My li-i-i-i-i-ife
            This is gonna be the best day of my life
            My li-i-i-i-i-ife
            
            I howled at the moon with friends
            And then the sun came crashing in
            Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh
            But all the possibilities
            No limits, just epiphanies
            Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh
            
            I'm never gonna look back, whoa
            I'm never gonna give it up, no
            Just don't wake me now
            
            This is gonna be the best day of my life
            My li-i-i-i-i-ife
            This is gonna be the best day of my life
            My li-i-i-i-i-ife
            
            I hear it calling outside my window
            I feel it in my soul (soul)
            The stars were burning so bright
            The sun was out 'til midnight
            I say we lose control (control)
            
            This is gonna be the best day of my life
            My li-i-i-i-i-ife
            This is gonna be the best day of my life
            My li-i-i-i-i-ife
            This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be
            The best day of my life
            Everything is looking up, everybody up now
            This is gonna be the best day of my life
            My li-i-i-i-i-ife
